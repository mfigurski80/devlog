# Coffee Reviews Origin

After about a year of lockdown, and so more than a year and a half of remote dating with my current girlfriend, we've been incredibly excited to get back together again at Emory, for the Fall semester. It's hard to believe that's only a few weeks away. We've been planning random things to do, and one of the more interesting ideas we've agreed on is to start a coffee review blog online, together.

Link is pending.

The idea is we go around different coffee shops within Atlanta. Ideally, we'll have a list of the top rated ones already and just go down the list, but I guess we'll make some consideration for how far away they are from us and how annoying they are to get to. We'll go, sit down, order something, and then write a review together that we'll end up posting to a random hidden online blog like this one. Maybe less hidden than this one since she's a marketing major. But still -- it's meant to be a documentation of our time together, just like this blog is meant to be a documentation of what I'm thinking about.

In summary, we want a wordpress blog for the easy online editing, we'll take pretty food-photography pictures, we'll rate based on 4 categories: mood/theme, price, baseline quality, and experimental quality. We'll order two different drinks -- one will be something we're familiar with, whether thats hot chocolate or mocha or something else, and another will be experimental -- we might ask the barista what they recommend or what the weirdest still-good thing they have is. And we might write some bullet points and comments on everything.

This means I'll be spending some time low-code creating a wordpress site. We'll see how it goes.The blog itself will be a lot of fun though. Honestly, there's so many things I want to do with her.
