# On First Positions

I've recently been hired by the Cyber-Sec company Cyderes, into their web engineering roles! It's a relatively-small company built around delivering CSOC-level services to smaller/mid-size companies. The org is actually the result of a merger between Fishtech and Herjavek Group about a year ago, and I have an unfortunate preference for the pre-merger company name: I work at Fishtech üê†üê†. Don't tell my boss I suppose

When I was initially in the process of planning out my leave from college, I had a very specific way I envisioned my future career, one that I feel is very common among CS students. Ideally, I'd work at a giant, respectable software company first, the likes of Google or Microsoft (I was willing to compromise to IBM) in order to gain whatever I needed for the future (for me: validation, money, something to point to on my resume in future negotiations), and then slowly move down into a more startup role where I'd be able to have tons of impact, and work on really cool products. This ended up not coming out.

Turns out, you don't need any of the things I was looking for in a large tech company. In fact, there's a good argument that the core thing I was looking for, actual technical experience, is easier to find at an established startup than anywhere else. Large companies frequently do more process than engineering, while startups let you rub shoulders with people who are in their late stage career and are still extremely motivated. More latitude for working on things, and more responsibility more quickly!

Anyway, I'm extremely happy with my company, can recommend it to anyone interested in software or cybersecurity.
